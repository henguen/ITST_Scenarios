# ITST_Scenarios

The simulation scenarios described in the ITST-Paper "The potential of Collective Perception" can be found here. The scenarios were created with the [TraficModeler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trafficmodeler/) Tool

The scenarios were used in conjunction with [Artery](https://github.com/riebl/artery) and the [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org) framework.

## Description of all files in each simulation generation
